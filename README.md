DATA SCIENCE ASSIGNMENT 1

In this file we have implemented Linear Regression on House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle challenge which will need us to do extensive data
pre-processing and then train the model for decent accuracy.
We generate a comparison of MSE, MAE, R2-score for all the five Linear Regression
algorithms based on cuML - Linear Regression library for doing house price
prediction.
